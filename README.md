## 🤖 Similar Projects to AI Voice Agent Platforms

**AI Voice Agent** platforms enable real-time conversational voice AI — combining speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), text-to-speech (TTS), telephony/WebRTC, tool calling, and orchestration for phone agents, inbound/outbound calling, and voice assistants. Leading commercial tools include Vapi, Retell AI, Bland AI, PlayAI, Synthflow, Air AI, Voiceflow, Hume AI, PolyAI, and Deepgram Voice Agent offerings.

Below is a **curated list** of notable platforms and their open-source equivalents. Fully managed, production-ready voice agent platforms with visual builders are less common in pure open source, so the emphasis is on **self-hostable frameworks and platforms** that give full control over the stack (STT → LLM → TTS + telephony).

## 🔓 Open-Source Software

### 🚀 Full Platforms / Closest Vapi & Retell Alternatives
- **[Dograh](https://github.com/dograh-hq/dograh)** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dograh-hq/dograh?style=social&color=white)](https://github.com/dograh-hq/dograh/stargazers) — Leading open-source, self-hostable voice AI platform and direct alternative to Vapi/Retell. Features a visual workflow builder, telephony support (Twilio, Vonage, etc.), BYOK for STT/LLM/TTS (or speech-to-speech), MCP support, post-call analytics, and full self-hosting (BSD license). Strong production-oriented feature set.

### 🛠️ Real-Time Voice Agent Frameworks
- **[Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat)** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/pipecat-ai/pipecat?style=social&color=white)](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/stargazers) — Open-source Python framework (from Daily) for building real-time voice and multimodal conversational agents. Highly modular pipelines for VAD, STT, LLM, TTS, transports, and multi-agent coordination. Excellent for engineers who want full control.
- **[LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents)** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/livekit/agents?style=social&color=white)](https://github.com/livekit/agents/stargazers) — Open-source framework (Apache 2.0) built on LiveKit’s real-time WebRTC infrastructure. Lets you add Python/Node.js agents as participants in rooms with streaming STT/LLM/TTS pipelines, tool calling, and telephony/SIP support. Very popular for production real-time agents.
- **[TEN Framework / TEN-Agent](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent)** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent?style=social&color=white)](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent/stargazers) — Open-source framework for real-time multimodal conversational AI agents, including voice.
- **[Vocode](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-core)** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/vocodedev/vocode-core?style=social&color=white)](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-core/stargazers) — Open-source library/framework for building voice agents with pluggable STT, LLM, and TTS components (frequently cited alongside Pipecat and LiveKit).

### 🧱 Supporting Open-Source Building Blocks
- **Hugging Face speech-to-speech** and related cascaded pipelines — Modular open-source speech-to-speech stacks using Whisper/Parakeet (STT), open LLMs, and open TTS models.
- 🎙️ Local/open STT: faster-whisper, NVIDIA Parakeet, Silero VAD, etc.
- 🗣️ Local/open TTS: Kokoro, XTTS, Coqui, Fish Speech, Qwen-TTS, and others.
- ⚡ Real-time media: LiveKit (self-hosted), WebRTC stacks.
- Many teams assemble a full open stack: **Dograh or Pipecat/LiveKit Agents** (orchestration) + preferred STT/LLM/TTS + telephony provider.

### ⚙️ Typical Open-Source Voice Agent Stack
A common production-oriented open-source approach:
1. 🛠️ **Orchestration** — Dograh (visual) or Pipecat / LiveKit Agents (code-first)
2. 📝 **STT** — Deepgram, Gradium (real-time streaming speech-to-text with semantic turn detection), Whisper, Parakeet, or self-hosted alternatives
3. 🧠 **LLM** — Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (cloud or self-hosted)
4. 🔊 **TTS** — ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Gradium (real-time streaming text-to-speech), Kokoro, or other open models
5. 📞 **Transport** — Twilio/Vonage/SIP or LiveKit WebRTC

This gives full data ownership and eliminates per-minute platform markups while retaining flexibility.
